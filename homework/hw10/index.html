			<h1>Homework1</h1>
			<h3>Develop an XML file to represent a book of recipes.</h3>
			<p>I think my favorite football club could be a good choice.</p>

			<img src = "xsv.png" />
			<br />
			<a href = "code/team_xsd.html">Click to see the code of XSD file</a>

			<h1>Homework3</h1>
			<h3>Format your XML using an XSLT stylesheet.</h3>

			<a href = "code/team_xsl.html">Click to see the code of XSL file</a>

			<h1>Homework4</h1>
			<h3>Include links to your .xsl, .xsd and .xml files on your homework page.</h3>
			<a href = "code/team_xml.html">Click to see the code of XML file</a>
			<a href = "code/team_xsd.html">Click to see the code of XSD file</a>

		</div>
		
		<div class = "content">		
			<h1>Homework5</h1>
			<h3>Write a short article if you wish to draw the markers attention to something you are pleased with!</h3>
			<p>I have learned something about XML, XSD and XSL by W3CSchool. There are some helpful materials:<br /><br />
			<a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp">XML Tutorial</a>
			<a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/schema/default.asp">XML Schema Tutorial</a>
			<a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/default.asp">XSL Tutorial</a><br /><br />
			To complete this homework, I develop an XML file to represent a book of <b>my favourite football club</b> instead of recipes. I think you will enjoin it.<br /> 
			I collected all the information from: <br /><br />
			<a href = "http://www.fcbarcelona.com">www.fcbarcelona.com</a>
			<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona">FC_Barcelona in wikipedia</a><br /><br />
			And the XML also display pictures in order to look better.<br />
			In my opinion, XSD, XML and XSL are powerful but I'm just a beginner.
